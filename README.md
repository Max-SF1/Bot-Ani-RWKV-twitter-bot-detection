"Bot-Ani?" is a project aimed at developing a machine learning model for detecting bot accounts on Twitter using the RWKV model, a relatively new architecture that combines the strengths of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model tuning, and evaluation to effectively distinguish between human-operated and bot-operated Twitter profiles.  

## Motivation  

## Files
- DL report contains an ethic statement, as well as a final report with an architecture description, experimentation and more.
- preprocessing_twitter_bot.ipynb for preprocessing and feature extraction, as well as importing the data into a parquet file.
- Preprocessed_dataset.parquet is the preprocessed dataset file.
- {NEED TO COMPLETE ONCE THE FINAL RUN'S DONE}
